= Execute stuff when files change

This is a little ruby bash script, for watching a directory and executing a given bash command when changes occour.
  watchfs /some/folder "some bash command"

=== Installation
  chmod +x watch
  sudo mv watch /usr/bin/watchfs

=== Use Cases
I use it for instant execution of my testsuite, when I press cmd+s
  watchfs . "clear; rake test"

And build my javascript files when I press cmd+s
  watchfs . "clear; rake red"


=== Apple is awesome
Works only in OSX. Its actually a small modification of a script provided by Apple originally found at
  /Developer/Examples/Ruby/RubyCocoa/Scripts/watcher.rb
